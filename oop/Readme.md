# Ceng 443 - OOP HW1 

### How To Run ? 

Default compilation method is still valid for this project. If you are using IntellJ, you can create a application run/config for this project and select main class as Game .

### How To Play ?

In Default, keyboard Q, W, E buttons adds towers. When you run project, game directly starts. 
Depending on the mouse location, it adds the towers. 

Q => Regular Tower
W => Poison Tower 
E => Ice Tower

Unfortunately, There exist just 2 bugs I see in the code which are Ice Tower attacks stops the monster, not make it move slower. Other one is zigzag direction sometimes buggy. Sorry  for that. I couldn't find time to handle that error.
